# PubG-Score-Prediction- 
Using LightBGM to predict score of pubG player on.


Problem Statement :
In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match. Players can be on teams which get ranked at the end of the game based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different ammunition, revive knocked teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, heal etc We are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 players per group. We must create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).
